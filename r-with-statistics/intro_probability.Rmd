co-relation does not imply causation, what determines whether we can infer causation or just corelation is the type of study that we're basing our conclusions. Observational studies for the most part allows us to only make corelational statements.

While experiments allow us to infer causation. It is said for the most parts, because there are actually more advanced methods broadfly titled causal inference that allow for making causal infernces for observational studies.
